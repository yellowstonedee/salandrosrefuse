In 1979 Salandro's Refuse, Inc. was established in Jeanette Pennsylvania with only a '68 Chevy pickup truck and friendly, reliable garbage service.  From there the fleet quickly expanded and Salandro's bought their first rear load garbage truck in 1980, it was a '71 International.  Salandro's continued to provide reliable residential curbside pickup and added Roll-off service in 1991.  In 1995 residential pick-up was stopped to better focus on roll-off services.  Today Salandro's operates a fleet of 6 roll-off trucks out of Crabtree, PA and provides services to Westmoreland and surrounding counties.
